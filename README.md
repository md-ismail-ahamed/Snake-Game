🐍 Snake Game – A Web-Based Grid Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, where the player controls a snake on a 25×25 grid to consume food and grow longer.
The game logic handles real-time movement, collision detection, and dynamic UI updates with efficient use of JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
